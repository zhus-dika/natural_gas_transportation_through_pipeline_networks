# Natural gas transportation through pipeline networks
### Source code for modelling natural gas transportation through pipeline networks

**Guide to run code:**


To run calculations follow instructions below:

1---> run code in the file calculateFunctions.nb

2---> run code in the file calculateProcedures.nb

3---> run code in the file linearSegmentCalculations.nb

results will be shown in the file linearSegmentCalculations.nb

The calculation results will be written in the .dat files. 
The construction of graphs based on the obtained numerical results is implemented in the file linearSegmentCalculations.nb.

### Example output plots:
